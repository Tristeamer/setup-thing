# setup-thing
A thing I made after some googleing to install some programs on my laptop because I was tired of doing it myself.

I have no idea why you would ever want to use this as it only works for like 10 programs and its really poorly made and probably doesnt even work but if you want to go ahead.

If you actually would like to use this then do this ig:

Open a terminal
Then enter the following commands: 

1. ```wget https://github.com/Tristeamer/setup-thing/releases/download/v1.0.0/setupthing.sh```
2. ```chmod u+x setupthing.sh```
3. ```./setupthing.sh```

Then hope it works.
